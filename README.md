# Weather-App-using-java
A weather app project made by using java 

The project is basically an android application using Java which helps to forecast the weather for its user according to the name of city he has entered. Further, the app will tell about the current date, temperature, humidity, pressure and other information related to the weather to its user.
There is a background image in the weather app. There is a title text and an area code. A city name must be typed into the input search box. To find out the weather, click the search icon. The data will be seen in text view. Based on the specified url, the weather app provides the information. JSON libraries are used



To fetch the information from a location, there is a need of API through which the weather of a city can be fetched easily. There are free APIs available used to fetch the weather information.
Applications can interact and share data using different components and micro services by using an API (Application Programming Interface).For this project, I have used Open Weather Map API to extract the weather information. ( https://openweathermap.org/api
